### Styling

The website uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy color customization:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #d4af37;      /* Gold accent color */
    --primary-dark: #b8941f;       /* Darker gold for hover states */
    --secondary-color: #2c2c2c;    /* Dark background color */
    --accent-color: #f8f5f0;       /* Light cream background */
}
```

### Adding Real Images

Replace the placeholder elements with actual images:

1. Create an `images/` folder
2. Add your photos (recommended: 800x600px for portfolio, 400x400px for about)
3. Replace the `.image-placeholder` divs with `<img>` tags

Example:
```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<div class="image-placeholder">
    <i class="fas fa-scissors"></i>
    <p>Classic Bob Cut</p>
</div>

<!-- With this -->
<img src="images/classic-bob.jpg" alt="Classic Bob Cut">
```

## üöÄ Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Method 1: Direct Upload (Recommended)

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New" repository
   - Name it something like `hairdresser-website` or `salon-website`
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

2. **Upload files**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`)
   - Commit the files

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access your website**:
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`
   - It may take a few minutes to become available

### Method 2: Git Command Line

If you have Git installed:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial website setup"

# Add remote repository (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then follow steps 3-4 from Method 1.
